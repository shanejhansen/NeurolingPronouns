# NeurolingPronouns
This repository contains the code used in the development and analysis of my Neurolinguistics Bachelor of Philosophy study. The study sought to investigate the differences in neurolinguistic processing of nonbinary pronoun constructions (NBPCs, e.g. singular 'they') in an individual's first vs second language. The study trained naive learners on a limited set of French grammar and vocabulary and assessed neural responses to NBPCs using Event Related Brain Potentials (ERPs). Additional behavioral/psychometric correlations were also investigated. The full report on the experiment can be found here (still writing). Please cite this paper for any use of code and materials in this repository.
